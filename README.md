This project demonstrates how to create a **Docker image with nginx as a reverse proxy and application NodeJS made a register a name in Database MySQL**.

## 📥 Download the Docker Image from Docker Hub

To download and run the minimal Golang Docker image from Docker Hub, follow these steps:

1. **Ensure Docker is Installed**  
   Make sure Docker is installed on your machine. You can check by running:
   ```bash
   docker --version
   ```
2. **Pull the Image from Docker Hub**
    Run the following command to download the image:
    ```bash
    docker pull mikeoliveira/fc-desafio-go:latest
    ```
    [Link - Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/mikeoliveira/fc-desafio-go/tags)

3. **Verify the Downloaded Image**
    Check that the image has been downloaded successfully:

    ```bash
    docker images
    ```

    > You should see mikeoliveira/fc-desafio-go listed.

4. **Run the Docker Container**
